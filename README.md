# MC-Games-Browser
This is a concept of a new type of Minecraft Launcher, it is like a server browser, but, you download the files of the server and self-host on your machine for your friends to play, with security and almost no configuration at all!  
  
And will allow no host cost for the developer (no need for pay-to-win), no high ping, multilingual, save system, and a lot of new possibilities.  
  
Obviously, depending on the type of server that you are doing, this can not be too much attractive, it is more focus on mini games, unique servers, experiments and so on, for example, if your server is a SMP, you will likely pay for a host if its not build with self-host in mind.

Who can the developers gain money?

With this model in mind, its is similar of how digital video games store works, you pay a one time payment and the files is yours, or nothing if the server is free, but, i also thinking of 2 ideias  
  
1 - Pay what you want/Donations
  
2 - DLCs

If you do a open source launcher with this idea, the files can be a repository, and the player downloads directly from here.

Who my PC will handle a whole server?

It is very lightweight to host a Paper server, and with the amount of good hardware with easy acess, this is not even a problem because you only are hosting for you and your friends to play.

Who safe it is  to host a server?

Nowadays we have things like "Minekube Connector" that can do this work for you, or use things like lan broadcaster and use a private VPN like "Radmin", this is very secure compare to opening a port for everyone on the internet.  
  
Ideias!  
  
- A custom ModPack for QoL or custom mods, this can be open for a new category of mods only for this.
- Social System with friends recommended servers
